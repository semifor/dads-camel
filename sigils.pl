# The term sigil derives from the Latin sigillum, meaning "seal", though it may
# also be related to the Hebrew סגולה (segula meaning "word, action, or item of
# spiritual effect, talisman"). The current use of the term is derived from
# Renaissance magic, which was in turn inspired by the magical traditions of
# antiquity. - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigil_(magic)
